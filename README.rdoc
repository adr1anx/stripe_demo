Setting up development.

clone the repo, bundle install, and set up your environment variables.  You'll need postgres for this application - it uses the rails-money gem which uses the money column type for postgres.  If you have it installed, simply createdb revv_development to create the development database.  You'll also want to create a revv_test database for running tests.

Very few environment variables are needed.  For ease of use, there is an included .env.development file with stripe dev credentials included.  DEV_USER and DEV_PASSWORD may be needed for postgres.
